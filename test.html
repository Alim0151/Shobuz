        <div class="goal-text frosted-card" id="overview-heading">
        <span class="highlight-goal">Our Goal</span> is to create a grassroots financial lines MGA with a view of becoming an outright insurer. We will achieve our goals with hard work instead of institutional support; patience instead of leverage; and with the British public at the heart of what we do.
        <p><strong>Grassroots Insurance</strong> is a project to create a new Financial Lines Managing General Agent (MGA) founded on the principles of sustainable growth, ethical underwriting, and community benefit. Our mission is to address unmet demand in the UK’s complex financial lines insurance sector by offering fair, principled, and human-centred coverage.</p>
      </div>

      <h2 class="section-title">What We're Solving</h2>

        <div class="highlight-box frosted-card" role="region" aria-label="Problem statement">
        <strong>The Problem</strong>
        <p>Insurance is essential to society. Many providers are owned by private equity or large corporate interests; that can create incentives misaligned with long-term public good. We see unfulfilled demand and client dissatisfaction, particularly in Financial Lines.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="two-column">
          <div class="column frosted-card" aria-hidden="false">
        <strong>What is a Financial Lines MGA?</strong>
        <p>An MGA (Managing General Agent) is trusted by an insurer to underwrite policies on their behalf. Underwriting is the pricing of risk — in our case, financial-lines exposures.</p>
        <p>Financial lines focus on professional risks (D&O, PII, EPL, CPL). A Financial Lines MGA assesses that risk and places it with capacity providers.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="column frosted-card">
        <strong>What do we mean by Grassroots?</strong>
        <p>A grassroots business is community-driven and built from the ground up. This business will be started by myself, backed by the King's Trust and our community.</p>
        <p>We will minimise institutional involvement by:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>No equity or options available to private entities or institutions</li>
          <li>Starting and maintaining minimal leverage</li>
          <li>Ensuring future stakeholders align with our values</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      </div>

      <div class="benefits-list" aria-label="Benefits list">
        <p><strong>This includes:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>More clarity on what you're covered for</li>
          <li>Proactive support to protect your business</li>
          <li>Free, accessible underwriting information</li>
          <li>No unfair claim denials or delays</li>
          <li>Clear, honest language at all times</li>
          <li>Fairer pricing:
            <ul>
              <li>No hidden fees or unclear excesses</li>
              <li>No inflated prices to maximise profits</li>
              <li>No arbitrary price hikes</li>
              <li>No undercutting that leads to unfair practices</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

        <div class="highlight-box frosted-card">
        <strong>Current Market Context</strong>
        <p>The world is becoming more litigious and regulatory frameworks continue to shift — creating both challenges and opportunities for community-focused insurers. We are positioned to help businesses navigate these changes.</p>
      </div>

        <div class="risk-box frosted-card" role="region" aria-label="Risk & resilience">
        <h3>🛡️ Built to Last</h3>
        <p>Our business is designed for stability and adaptability:</p>
        <ul class="risk-list">
          <li>Minimal market and credit risk due to a diversified portfolio.</li>
          <li>Operational risk kept low via lean structure and automation.</li>
          <li>5% of revenue ring-fenced for comprehensive professional indemnity insurance.</li>
          <li>Flexible spending: actuary fees, software, and marketing can be scaled back in downturns.</li>

      <p>Financial lines are a category of insurance coverage designed to protect businesses and individuals against financial risks.</p>

      <div class="two-column">
          <div class="column frosted-card">
        <strong>Directors and Officers Insurance (D&O)</strong>
        <p>Protects officers from personal financial loss if they are sued for decisions made in their roles.</p>
            <p><strong>Real Scenario:</strong> If a client company becomes insolvent before paying a large invoice and the insured directors are sued by employees or creditors, D&O would assist with defence costs and settlements.</p>
      </div>

          <div class="column frosted-card">
        <strong>Professional Indemnity Insurance (PII)</strong>
        <p>Protects professionals against claims of negligence, errors or omissions.</p>

      <div class="two-column">
          <div class="column frosted-card">
        <strong>Corporate Practices Liability (CPL)</strong>

        <strong>Abdul Alim - Founder & CEO</strong>
    <p>I grew up in Liverpool studying Accountancy and Finance at the University of Liverpool. It has always been a dream of mine to own my own financial business that improves its community - not just a typical local firm, but something larger that impacts wider society.</p>
    <p>My working career has been in finance, starting with work experience at a local accountancy firm on Penny Lane. At TSB, I was inspired by the public when working for various branches in Manchester. I learnt to appreciate my financial literacy and felt a sense of responsibility in helping others with my expertise.</p>
    <p>I first worked in the insurance industry with the Co-operative insurance in 2019 and first worked as a financial lines underwriter at the Royal and Sun Alliance plc. I instantly realised financial lines underwriting was the career that was best suited to me. It rewarded my learning style, tenacity and creativity.</p>
    <p>I was head hunted by Aqueous in 2023 to be a Professional Indemnity Underwriter. I was convinced by the plan they had for me, the training opportunities and the opportunity to work closely with some of the most experienced underwriters in the industry.</p>
    <p>In my spare time, I love learning all about finance and companies. What makes businesses a success, why some businesses fail and how macro events affect local businesses. I've more recently grown an obsession with law in relation to the financial world.</p>
    <p>My experience within the industry has made me realise there is so much unfulfilled demand and dissatisfaction. The constraints of my role meant I could not satisfy the personal responsibility I feel for others. This is why I am starting my own financial lines MGA.</p>
