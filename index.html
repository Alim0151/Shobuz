  <p>Get in touch by email: <span class="email">Hello@Shobuz.co.uk</span></p>

  <p>Welcome, Shobuz.co.uk is the foundational work of our grassroots financial lines MGA. We will explain what our goal is, why we are passionate about this, how it benefits society and how we aim to get there.</p>

  <p class="section-title">Background</p>
  <p>The UK’s insurance market size is estimated to be £290bn. The top insurers are all traded publicly around the world. The majority owners of these companies are institutional investors, including Vanguard, BlackRock and Legal & General.</p>
  <p>These insurers have a duty to their investors to maximise their returns, with many investors residing outside the UK. This means insurers in the UK prioritise returns over people when providing cover.</p>
  <p>In more recent years, insurance companies are looked at less favourably. There is a belief that they prioritise profits over people, using unfair tactics like stalling or refusing to pay out fair claims. But insurance wasn’t always like this.</p>
  <p>The core principle of insurance is spreading risk so that when misfortune strikes, no one suffers catastrophic loss alone. Insurance as a concept dates back thousands of years, emerging across cultures worldwide.</p>

  <p class="section-title">Our Goal</p>
  <p>Our goal is to create a grassroots financial lines MGA, aiming to become an outright insurer. We will achieve this with hard work, patience, and the British public at the heart of everything we do.</p>

  <div class="two-column">
    <div class="column">
      <strong>What is a Financial Lines MGA?</strong>
      <p>MGA stands for "Managing General Agent" — an entity trusted by a larger insurer to underwrite policies.</p>
      <p>Underwriting is the practice of pricing risk for a premium. Underwriters decide how much is fair to accept a risk on someone else’s behalf. In our case, that focus is on insurance.</p>
      <p>Financial Lines is a type of insurance, which we will discuss more later.</p>
      <p>So, a Financial Lines MGA is trusted to assess how much a financial risk is worth and offer cover accordingly.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <strong>What do we mean by Grassroots?</strong>
      <p>A grassroots business is community-driven and built from the ground up.</p>
      <p>This business will be started by myself, backed by the King’s Trust and our community.</p>
      <p>We will minimise institutional involvement by:
        <ul>
          <li>No equity or options available to private entities or institutions</li>
          <li>Starting and maintaining minimal leverage</li>
          <li>Ensuring future stakeholders align with our values</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>We want insurance with its feet and ears to the ground, bringing it closer to the community. Your underwriters should truly believe in you.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>This includes:
    <ul>
      <li>More clarity on what you’re covered for</li>
      <li>Proactive support to protect your business</li>
      <li>Free, accessible underwriting information</li>
      <li>No unfair claim denials or delays</li>
      <li>Clear, honest language at all times</li>
      <li>Fairer pricing:
        <ul>
          <li>No hidden fees or unclear excesses</li>
          <li>No inflated prices to maximise profits</li>
          <li>No arbitrary price hikes</li>
          <li>No undercutting that leads to unfair practices</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

    <strong>Real Life Case Study</strong>
    <p>USA has "Obamacare", requiring insurers to spend at least 80% of premiums on medical care and quality improvement.</p>
    <p>UnitedHealthcare has faced lawsuits for underpaying claims while maintaining low premiums, allowing them to win business while failing to fairly support their customers. This has led to serious consequences for people's health and well-being.</p>
